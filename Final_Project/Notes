Pattern recognition with machine learning.

03.05
image segmentation - 
unsupervised learning - no lable on data, finding clusters by color indiferences

clone openCV source code - face recognition:
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/python/facedetect.py

wich faces are recognized the fastest
pigment differences between recognized faces (plotting, clusters)
