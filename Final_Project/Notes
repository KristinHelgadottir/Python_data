1. Pattern recognition with machine learning.

image segmentation - 
unsupervised learning - no lable on data, finding clusters by color indiferences
clone openCV source code - face recognition
wich faces are recognized the fastest
pigment differences between recognized faces (plotting, clusters)

Python is a single-threaded language, meaning, each script will only use a single cpu 
(usually it uses a single cpu core, and sometimes even just half or a quarter, or worse, of that core).
